Two performers mirror the same action repeatedly: one takes a cup of water from bowl A and pours it into bowl B, and the other does the opposite. In the center, the third performer walks in a large circle repeatedly. She is blindfolded and carries a live fish in a bowl. She dips her feet in this bowl making her footprints on the concrete floor. A 5 minute audio-visual file is projected on a wall and repeated throughout.',

I move to the side, or squat down a bit, so that I can see what I draw on the mirror. The surface is very shiny and my pens are semitransparent. From an angle, I try to confirm if what I have drawn matches what I think I see. Then I bring myself back to the original position, the right position. I start to see the colors. Cold or warm. Mat or Shiny. place the dark lines. finalize the image. And Shatter.',
